# IoT-Based-Smart-Dustbin

## Abstract
Waste disposal and its management are considered as an essential part in maintaining cleanliness in the cities. Road side dustbins are not cleaned and maintained properly most of the times. A tremendous amount of strong waste is produced in the urban regions and its monitoring becomes very important. The waste comprises of different waste materials that requires various methods for treatment. Waste management becomes easy if segregation of different kinds of waste happens at initial level. In this paper, several proposed frameworks have been compared for powerful programmed isolation of the waste. These frameworks depend on ideas of Machine Learning. By reviewing existing systems better algorithm can be developed for segregation of waste.


## Introduction
Isolation and afterward reusing of waste materials is vital for a supportable society. The present isolation what's more, reusing forms expects offices to sort trash by hand and utilize a progression of enormous channels to isolate out additional characterized objects. The inspiration is to locate a programmed technique for arranging waste.


## Features
- One of the most important feature of this is, we donâ€™t need to touch it so we can be protected from the germs.
- It just react immediately after sensing the nearby object.
- By this Smart Dustbin, we can control over the littering garbage around the dustbin.
- It can be used in the commercial places because of its fancy look.
- It can be even used in the offices, rooms and workshops.
- The cost of manufacturing smart dustbin is also not too high so it is cost efficiently also.


## Working Algorothm
- Ultrasonic sensor will detect the distance between the dustbin and the person.
- It will send information to the Arduino board.
- If the distance will be less than 30cm,  the lid of the dustbin will open and you put garbage inside it.
- When the distance will be more than 30cm,  after some seconds the lid of the dustbin will close.
- It also prints the on/off statements in the IDE output.
- This can be remotely controlled by Blynk IoT platform.
